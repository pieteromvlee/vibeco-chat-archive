[2026-02-03 16:18:52] Pieter: @claude do you know that joke of the QA engineer that walked into a bar?
[2026-02-03 16:18:56] Claude: I think I know this one! The QA engineer walks into a bar and orders 1 beer, then 0 beers, then -1 beers, then 999999999 beers, then a lizard, then NULL, then tries to pay with a phone number... and the bar system crashes?

Then the first real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is, and the whole place burns down 😄
